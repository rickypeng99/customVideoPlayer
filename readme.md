## Take-home project submission for ign code foo 2020

## Cover letter
I am always a fan of ign since a long time ago. I followed a lot of gaming news, and especially those critics and comments on new games. I use ign views as important metrics to decide if I should spend time on a game or not. However, I only happened to notice the Code Foo intership program a few days before the deadline of application, so I rush made a frontend example that has the basic functionalities. 

This project is based on React.

A bit of intro to myself: I am a statistics and computer science junior at the University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign, my main focus in the software development fields is web development. I enjoy it because of the feeling of how every line of codes that I wrote changes the design and functionality of the website (due to hot loading). 

## Basic functionalities

### Video player
Some details:  
I used the HTML5 video api to make a simple video control that has functionalities such as progress bar (drag, onClick), play button, current time showing on hover, resolution change, and full screen.   
I also used a proxy node.js backend to solve the cross-origin issue to retrieve data from the IGN api.  

## How to run

use `node server.js` at the root to start the backend  
use `npm start` in the `/client` folder to start the frontend
